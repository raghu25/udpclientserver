UDPPingerServer.py

these programs use a simpler protocol, UDP, rather than the standard Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to communicate with each other.
The ping protocol allows a client machine to send a packet of data to a remote machine, and have the remote machine return the data back to the client unchanged (an action referred to as echoing).



The ping protocol allows a client machine to send a packet of data to a remote machine, and have the remote machine return the data back to the client unchanged (an action referred to as echoing). Among other uses, the ping protocol allows hosts to determine round-trip times to other machines.

the minimum, maximum, and average RTTs and percentage packet loss at the end of sending 50 packets have been calculated.
